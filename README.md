# Neural Networks in solving Minesweeper
The aim of this project is to show efficiency of chosen neural network implementations in solving Minesweeper when compared to much simpler analytical solutions. This repository contains all the code written for the needs of this project as well as directory of result files used to create documentation.

## What files to run and in what order:
1. Run *_0_solve_human.py* to play the game manually (optional)
2. Run *_1_solve_anaytical.py* and *_1_solve_analytical_5x5.py* to create datasets used in training nn models
3. Run *_2_train_MODEL.py* files to create and train models
4. Run *_3_solve_MODEL.py* files to check how trained models perform
5. Run *_4_train_decision_tree.py* to create decision tree showing model preferences when making decisions (uses logs created in point 3)
6. Run *_5_display_decision_tree.py* to display decision trees from previous point
